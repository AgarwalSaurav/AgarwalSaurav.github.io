<p>
I am a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am part of the Robotics Laboratory. 
My research focus is on Motion Planning for Multiple Robots. Specifically, I am developing algorithms to solve Arc Routing Problems for Robotics applications.

The line coverage problem using multiple aerial robots requires the robots to collect data from a given network of lines, which may be from a road network or power line network.
My research focuses on developing algorithm that reduce the mission time required to survey a network of linear features.
I also ensure that the amount of data gathered is significantly less than from the corresponding area coverage.
This reduces the amount of computation required to analyze the environment thereby allowing quick analysis and deployment of resources.

<p>
I am working on developing core heuristic algorithms that solve the line coverage problem efficiently and, characterizing the quality of the heuristic solutions when compared to the optimal solutions.
My next step is to design real-time intelligent systems while incorporating practical constraints, such as line-of-sight constraints, collision avoidance and non-holonomic nature of certain robots.

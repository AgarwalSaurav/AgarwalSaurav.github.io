### Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This paper introduces a new approach for the design of planar six-bar mechanisms for
the purpose of function generation. The structural error is formulated using the input-
output relationship of such a mechanism. In addition to the conventional structural er-
ror, its derivative is minimised via numerical optimisation, leading to the novel concept
of dual-order structural error , which lends itself naturally to a multi-objective formulation
of the design problem. Furthermore, analytical conditions for the mobility of the mecha-
nism are derived for two cases: mobility for the full cycle of the crank, and for any given
subset of it, along with the identification of the kinematic branches. These conditions help
confine the numerical search for the optimal designs to the feasible regions of the design
space, leading to a very efficient computational scheme. The results obtained are better in
accuracy as compared to the reported results in existing literature. The formulation and
results are demonstrated in the context of the Watt-II and the Stephenson-III mechanisms.

### Abstract
---
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This paper introduces a new approach for the
synthesis of planar six-bar mechanisms via multi-objective
numerical optimisation. Using the input-output relation-
ship of such a mechanism, the structural error is formu-
lated. In addition to the structural error, its derivative is
also included in the objectives, leading to results which are
comparable in accuracy to the exact methods reported in
existing literature, and better than the optimisation-based
methods. Also, analytical conditions are derived for the
identification of the candidate designs which are free of sin-
gularities, mobility or branch defects. The formulation and
results are demonstrated in the context of a Stephenson-III
mechanism, though these can be generalised to the six-bar
mechanisms of other topologies.

The objective of the project is to implement and analyze Probabilistic Road Map (PRM) algorithm for motion
planning of multiple robots with variable formation. By variable formation we mean that the robots can change
the scale and orientation of the formation while maintaining a given shape. The system of robots hence have
five degrees of freedom, i.e., three for translation, scale, and orientation about the \(Z\)-axis. The PRM algorithm
is implemented as it can handle high dimensional configuration space. Additional connectivity, expansion, and
smoothing techniques are implemented to improve upon the solutions generated. Examples of different numbers
of robots in various shapes are considered to analyze the efficacy of the algorithm. The algorithm is implemented
using Python 2.7 and Klampâ€™t motion planning framework.

<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
Teams of robots often maintain a desired shape while performing tasks such as exploration,
coverage, and surveillance. These formations can have the
flexibility in the scale and orientation of the formation while maintaining the given
shape. These additional degrees of freedom allows us to navigate through narrow passages
in the environment. In this project we study an analyze the
Probabilistic Roadmap path planning method to perform path planning in
a static environment with obstacles.

<p>
Several efficient path planning techniques exist for low dimensional configuration space. Roadmap methods in \(\mathbb R^2\) include visibility graph, which can give optimal paths, Voronoi
roadmap which keep the path far away from the obstacles (along the medial axis). Cell
decomposition methods divide the free configuration space of the robots into cells.
Thereafter, a connectivity graph is created to with the cells. Given query points, a path
is found in the connectivity graph. These methods can solve 2D configuration spaces
efficiently. However, the as the dimension increases, the number of cells increases
exponentially and both the space and time complexity increases. Potential field methods is
another class of motion planning technique wherein potential functions dictate the
motion of the robots. The goal position has an attractive potential and the obstacles
(potentially other robots as well) have repulsive potential. The forces on the robot are
then computed based on the potential function. The method suffers from getting stuck at
local minima and designing potential navigation functions may not be trivial. 
<br>

All the algorithms discussed above do not perform well when the dimension of the
configuration space increases. In general the motion planning problem is PSPACE-hard.
Owing to this difficult, in the past decade there have been significant advances in
sampling based techniques. One such method is Probabilistic Roadmap
(PRM) composed of a learning phase and a query phase. The learning phase builds a roadmap and in the query
phase shortest path in computed in the roadmap. The PRM has been shown to be effective in
various environments with high dimensional configurations of robots. There have been
several improvements and variants to PRM. One notable improvement is
PRM*, which gives asymptotically optimal solutions. Other variants
are visibility-PRM, Obstacle based-PRM etc.

<h2> Problem Description </h2>

<p>
Consider a team of \(n\) robots. These robots are arranged in a desired shape given by \( \mathbf S =(\mathbf s_j^\top), j = 1, \ldots n\) with respect to a local coordinate system attached to the system of robots. The configuration of the system of robots is given by a five dimensional vector \(\mathbf q = (x, y, z, \alpha, \theta)^\top\), where \(\mathbf q_t = (x, y, z)^\top\) defines the location in the \(\mathbb R^3\) space, \(\alpha\) is the scale parameter for the robots, and \(\theta\) is the orientation of the formation about the \(Z\)-axis. The location of the individual robots in the world coordinate system can now be written as \(\mathbf p_j = \mathbf q_t + \mathbf R \alpha \mathbf s_j\), where \(\mathbf R\) is the rotation matrix corresponding to a rotation by an angle \(\theta\) about the \(Z\)-axis. Given an initial and goal configuration, the task is then to compute an obstacle-free path in the environment.

We assume the following:
<ol>
  <li> The robots are holonomic, i.e., they can move in any direction. </li>
  <li>  The position of the individual robots, and thereby the position and orientation of
    the robotic system can be obtained exactly. </li>
  <li> The environment in 2D or 3D is static and known, i.e., the location of the obstacles are provided exactly.  </li>
    <li> There is no error in the motion of the robots, i.e., the robots move exactly as commanded.  </li>

</ol>
</p>

<h2>Probabilistic Roadmap</h2>
<p>
We use Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM), a sampling based technique, for creating a {\em roadmap} in the configuration space of the robot. 
The roadmap here refers to an undirected graph in the configuration space where in the
nodes represent sampled configurations and the edges represent collision-free paths which the system of robots can take. 
The weight of the edges represent the cost of travelling through the two nodes of the
edge.

The PRM and its improvement PRM* have the following characteristics which make it suitable for our problem:
<ol>
  <li> Probabilistically complete: probability of finding a solution (if one exist)
    approaches to one as the running time approaches to infinity. The algorithm will generate a roadmap such that path between any two configuration points can be determined if it exists, given sufficient
    time for running the algorithm. </li>
    <li> Asymptotically optimal: the probability of find the optimal path (if one exist) approaches to
    one as the running time approaches infinity. The algorithm will find the most optimal path for the query if sufficient time is given for running building the roadmap.</li>
    <li> The PRM method can handle high-dimensional configuration space. In our problem we
      have a five dimensional configuration space. </li>
    <li> Once the roadmap is created, the multiple queries can be performed on the same
      environment, which is computationally very efficient.</li>
</ol>

</p>
<p>
There are few caveats to the PRM method. The probabilistically complete and asymptotically
optimal features require building an large sized graph with algorithm running for a
long time. This also creates slower query decisions. However, in practice fewer samples
points may be enough for generating good paths.

<h2> Experiments </h2>

<p>

Running time experiments were performed to understand the variation in running time with
the number of robots (1--10). The environment for the experiment is shown below. The
number of samples were fixed to 2000. The maximum number of nodes to connect  from a new
sample was set to 15. The neighbor hood distance was 0.75 times the number of robots. The
sampling for collision detection was set to a distance of 0.04. The query time was
averaged over 100 random queries. There were at the most 1 failure. It can be seen from
the plots that the running time in learning phase increases with increase in the number of robots. However,
the increase is not very steep. The number of nodes not connected to any other node also
increases with number of robots. This is because the size of the formation increases and
it becomes more difficult to connect configurations using collision-free path.

One interesting plot is of running time of query phase. The running time first increases
with the number of robots and then decreases. The running time is more for
3--6 number of robots. This is because of the neighborhood distance is small 
which causes the shortest path composed of several very small
segments. The complexity of the smoothing process is proportional to the number of
segments in the shortest path. Hence, the running time increases for smaller number of
robots. The running time increases for 1--4 robots because the collision detection is
implemented to ensure the paths are collision free.
